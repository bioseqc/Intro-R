## Overview

R is a complete, flexible and open source system for statistical analysis and graphics, which has become a tool of choice for biologists and biomedical scientists who need to analyse and visualise their experimental data. This 1-day course will give an introduction to R and Rstudio (an integrated development environment for R) in an interactive manner. Participants will receive example data sets to practice data manipulation, graphical exploration and statistical hypothesis testing. If you want to transition from coding in base R to the tidyverse, or just jump into doing data science in the tidyverse without any prior R experience, this workshop is for you! 

To review some basics about R, here are some resources for getting started:

- [A (very) short introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf)
- [DataCamp - Introduction to R with Jonathon Cornelissen](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)
- [Quick-R](https://www.statmethods.net)
- [Getting up to speed with R](https://rkabacoff.github.io/datavis/Rintro.pdf)

## Audience
 
This "One Day Introduction to R" is design to provide the participants skill set required to generate intuitive graphics from their laboratory experiments. 

Location: Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, Bauchi State University, Nigeria.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop course, participants should be comfortable with the R environment and be able to perform data science in Base R and Tidyverse that includes data clearning, data exploration and data visualisation and interpret a workflow for their data analysis:

- interact with the R environment
- import data, clean it and summarise it
- Visualise data by graphics

## Invited Instructor  

Dr. Umar Ahmad is a Visiting Research Fellow on Genetics (Cancer) with Genetics and Regenerative Medicine Research Centre (GRMCR) of the Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) and a lecturer in Molecular Genetics Informatics Unit of the Department of Anatomy, Bauchi State University, Nigeria. He is the founder and CEO of [BioSeq](https://bioseqc.com/), a bioinformatics company that translates omics data into informative knowledge by providing quality high-throughput sequencing (NGS) data analysis. Umar's graduate training (PhD in cancer research) at [Genetics and Regenerative Medicine Research Centre](https://grmrc.org/) of the Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) and the [Malaysia Genome Institute](https://mgi-nibm.my/v5/index.php) focused on developing targeted therapy for human bladder cancer with primary focus on genomics and transcriptomics through bioinformatics analyses of NGS data such as transcriptome (RNA-Seq) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. Thus, his research group works on identifying and elucidating the genetic components of regulatory and signalling pathways that drive cancer recurrence and progression with a primary focus on bladder cancer as a model. Umar is voluntarily serving as the bioinformatics coordinator at [Science Communication Hub Nigeria](https://www.scicomnigeria.org/), where he supports a team that provides mentorship, implements training and community building for the next generation of Nigerian scientists. He is currently the Scholarly Communication Lead at [AfricArXiv](https://info.africarxiv.org/) – The free preprint service for African scientists. He previously served as the Secretary to the Structure Organisation Committee (SOC) of the [Nigerian Bioinformatics and Genomics Network](http://www.nbgnetwork.org/), and now serves as the Regional Coordinator (North East) of the same organisation. He is passionate about genetics and genomics, bioinformatics, computational biology and data science. He is also a strong advocate for community building that supports the data-intensive biomedical research community and underrepresented groups in STEM fields. Umar is occasionally found on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/babasaraki1), sharing science and most of the time on [Github](https://github.com/babasaraki), organising codes and repositories. He is currently developing a R/Bioconductor package that could be used to extract bladder cancer RNA-Seq data from publicly available repositories.
